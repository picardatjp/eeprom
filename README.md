# README
# OLD
  There are two folders, "new" and "old". "old" is the older version of this project. It is poorly written and not practical in use. It can only program around 40 addresses max and the only way to specify what data was put in the EEPROM was to hardcode it. Extremely limited. 
# NEW
  The "new" folder is the newer version of this project. This newer version utilizes the EUSART capabilities of the pic16F18313 to program the EEPROM. This one can actually write enough data to fill up an EEPROM.
