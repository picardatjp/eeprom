# EEPROM PROGRAMMER
Written for the PIC16f18313 to program the AT28Cxxx EEPROM.


  Use: Set up and program your pic by using the entire 18313EEPROM.x MPLAB project folder or just copying the main.asm and putting it in your project. Put the eepic.exe in the directory of the .hex file you want to upload to the EEPROM or save it somewhere and append it to your PATH variable. You can also just use the eepic.py and run it. Type ".\eepic" (minus the quotes), enter in the file name, COM port, etc and it should send your file from your PC to the EEPROM. There will be more detailed explanations within each of the files.
